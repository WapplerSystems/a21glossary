Introduction
============

This extension has two general goals:

1) it adds special explanatory markup to acronyms, abbreviations and words in foreign languages on the whole page following the requirement for accessible web content
2) it provides a plugin to list all glossary entries on one page with a possibility to link all occurances of a word on the whole website to this page (and its explanation).

It can be used on multilanguage sites, it is highly configurable and extendable (e.g. new HTML elements for explanatory markup) and shows good performance.
